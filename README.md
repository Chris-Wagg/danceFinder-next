## What I'm working on

- This is a current work in progress project. The end goal for this is to develop a full production app that will be used in the real world. Initially I would like to have a filter system for people to be able to find studio's and dance classes.

- The final scope of the project would to be a social media site for dancers and studios to share and create content for each other.

## What tech I have used

- I initially started with a boiler plate using node and SQLite.
- The second iteration of the project moved to Next.js to work with a new framework and test the inbuilt routing.
- I then incorporated Prisma as the database to again work with a new technology.
- Redux toolkit was then added to deal with the global state management and work with a new piece of tech that I have not used before.

## Still to do

- Integrate prisma further.
- Begin implementing functionality.
- Work on accessibility and responsivity.
- Work on testing once functionality is added
- Fix package vulnerabilities

## Available scripts

npm run dev
